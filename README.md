There is the final dissertation I worked on.
There are the slides I showed at my final discussion.

## Project

The goal of the Wikimedia Community Health (WikiCHM) project is to measure and understand the Wikipedia community health status. The WikiCHM project wants to monitor it, because if we can understand something, we can interact with it, we can change it, and hopefully, we can improve it. In fact, the project does not limit itself to an ephemeral comprehension of the wellness of Wikipedia. It wants to give recommendation in order to ensure its prosperity and spread the information about it. These tips are for everybody who interacts with Wikipedia but are especially meant for its active users. 
In order to make this data understandable by everyone, even by non-technical people, visual dash- boards were created. These graphs make the information about Wikipedia health easy to read and its comprehension straight forward.
But before measuring Wikipedia health, we must define it. Like doctors can measure human body vital signs (heartbeat, cerebral activity, oxygen levels,...), so can we too: the project defines six metrics that can be analyzed and studied. These are called *Wikipedia Vital Signs*.
