\emph{
  I would like to thank the people that constantly helped and supported me during this incredible journey. They make my life better and worthy to be enjoyed and help me to become the man I am. And most importantly, they inspire me into becoming the man I will be tomorrow. Hence I want to thank my family: my parents, my sisters and my grandparents. They are always there for me and gave me everything I have. I will never be able to thank you enough.\\
  I want to thank my amazing girlfriend. She made me a happier person than I could ever hope to be. Most importantly, she inspires me constantly into wanting to improve myself. For me, for her, for us.\\
  I also want to thank professor Montresor, a great professor and a mentor, for having given me the opportunity of participating in this project.\\
  I think that being grateful is the most beautiful feeling ever.
